In this quick no fluff video, I will show you how to create a multi-bootable USB drive with Ventoy that can boot all of your ISO, WIM, IMG, VHD, and EFI files.  It supports both MBR and GPT partitions.   This is the last USB drive you will ever need and you won't ever need to format another one.  Ventoy is free and open source.
