[![Meet Jekyll - The Static Site Generator](https://img.youtube.com/vi/F8iOU1ci19Q/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q "Meet Jekyll - The Static Site Generator")

Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms your plain text into beautiful static web sites and blogs.  It can be use for a documentation site, a blog, an event site, or really any web site you like.   It's fast, secure, easy, and open source.  It's also the same site generator I use to maintain my open source documentation.  Today, we'll be installing and configuring Jekyll using the Chirpy theme.  We configure the site, create some pages with markdown, automatically build it with a GitHub action and even host it for FREE on GitHub pages.  If you don't want to host in the cloud, show how to host it on your own server or even in Docker.

## Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev git
```

To avoid installing RubyGems packages as the root user:

If you are using `bash` (usually the default for most)

```bash
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

If you are using `zsh` (you know if you are)

```bash
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Install Jekyll `bundler`

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler

```

## Creating a site based on Chirpy Starter

Visit <https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#quick-start>

After creating a site based on the template, clone your repo

```bash
git clone git@<YOUR-USER-NAME>/<YOUR-REPO-NAME>.git
```

then install your dependencies

```bash
cd repo-name
bundle
```

After making changes to your site, commit and push then up to git

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "made some changes"
git push
```

## Jekyll Commands

serving your site

```bash
bundle exec jekyll s
```

Building your site in production mode

```bash
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll b
```

This will output the production site to `_site`

## Building Site in CI

This site already works with GitHub actions, just push it up and check the actions Tab.,

For GitLab you can see the [pipeline I built for my own docs site here](https://github.com/techno-tim/techno-tim.github.io/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L18)

## Building with Docker

Create a `Dockerfile` with the following

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:stable-alpine
COPY _site /usr/share/nginx/html
```

Build site in production mode

```bash
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll b
```

Then build your image:

`docker build .`

## Creating a Post

### Naming Conventions

Jekyll uses a naming [convention for pages and posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)

Create a file in `_posts` with the format

```file
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md
```

For example:

```file
2022-05-23-homelab-docs.md
2022-05-34-hardware-specs.md
```

> Jekyll can delay posts which have the date/time set for a point in the future determined by the "front matter" section at the top of your post file. Check the date & time as well as time zone if you don't see a post appear shortly after re-build.

### Markdown Examples

If you need some help with markdown, check out the [markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

I have lots of examples in my [documentation site repo](https://github.com/techno-tim/techno-tim.github.io/tree/master/_posts).  Just click on the Raw button to see the code behind the page.
