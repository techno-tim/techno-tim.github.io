Let's build a bot!  Not a bad bot like a view bot, but bot for good.  Let's build a discord moderator bot using discord.js!  Discord is powerful chat + video client and already has lots of great bots however no bot has the flexibility of creating your own!  In this video I will show you how to build a discord bot using DiscordJS from start to finish.  You'll see how to use the developer portal, create a bot using JavaScript, NodeJS, and NPM, invite the bot to your Discord server and have it moderate some of your channels.  We have made this bot open source and will continue to contribute to this bot.
