## What is Flux?

**Flux** is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories), and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy. It's open source and you can read more about it on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2). Looking for a tutorial on how use this?  [Check out this video on how to use SOPS and Age for your Git Repos](/posts/flux-devops-gitops/)!

## Updating Flux

We're going to use `curl` so you'll want to be sure you have it installed

```bash
curl -V
```

This should return something similar to the following

```console
curl 7.68.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.68.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1f zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.7 libidn2/2.2.0 libpsl/0.21.0 (+libidn2/2.2.0) libssh/0.9.3/openssl/zlib nghttp2/1.40.0 librtmp/2.3
Release-Date: 2020-01-08
Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop3 pop3s rtmp rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp
Features: AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM NTLM_WB PSL SPNEGO SSL TLS-SRP UnixSockets
```

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl
```

Then we'll want to download the latest Flux binary by running

```bash
curl -s https://fluxcd.io/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Then we'll want to be sure it's installed properly by running

```bash
flux -v
```

This should return something similar to the following

```console
flux version 0.39.0
```

Next we'll need to locate our `gotk-components.yaml` file for flux in our git repo.  For example, mine lives in `clusters/cluster-01/base`


```console
clusters
├── cluster-01
│   ├── base
│   │   └── flux-system
│   │       └── gotk-components.yaml
```

One you locate `gotk-components.yaml` we'll patch it by using the following command

```bash
flux install --export > clusters/cluster-01/base/flux-system/gotk-components.yaml
```

After this file is updated, you can check to be sure it updated the correct file by running

```bash
git diff
```

You should see something like the following

```diff
diff --git a/clusters/cluster-01/base/flux-system/gotk-components.yaml b/clusters/cluster-01/base/flux-system/gotk-components.yaml
index 79576f0f..9c26b708 100644

if you see something other than the original `gotk-components.yaml` being updated, you might want to check the location of the file and try again.

Once this is updated, you can simply commit and push this up and let GitOps do the rest!

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(flux): Upgraded flux to 0.39.0" # replace with your verion
git push
```
