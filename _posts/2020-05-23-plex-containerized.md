[![4 Ways to Install Plex (one is unexpected)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/MG_1XQxWns0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG_1XQxWns0 "4 Ways to Install Plex (one is unexpected)")

I'm a huge fan of virtualization and containerization (if you couldn't tell already)!  Today, we'll walk though the various ways to install Plex step-by-step.  We also see how easy it is to get Plex running on Docker and Kubernetes using Rancher.

## Id for Container

Get Id and Group Id

```bash
id yourusername
```

Should see something like this:

```
uid=1001(technotim) gid=1001(technotim) groups=1001(technotim),27(sudo),999(docker)
```


## Mount Shares During Boot

Install `cifs-utils`

```bash
sudo apt-get install cifs-utils
```

Create credentials files for share

```bash
sudo nano /home/technotim/.smbcredentials
```


Set permissions

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.smbcredentials
```


```
username=yourUsyourusernameername  
password=yourPassword
```

Edit `/etc/fstab`

```bash
//192.168.0.22/plex_media/movies /mnt/movies cifs credentials=/home/technotim/.smbcredentials 0 0
//192.168.0.22/plex_media/music /mnt/music cifs credentials=/home/technotim/.smbcredentials 0 0
```
Then reboot or
```bash
sudo mount -a
``` 
to mount
