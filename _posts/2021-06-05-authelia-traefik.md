[![2 Factor Auth and Single Sign on with Authelia?](https://img.youtube.com/vi/u6H-Qwf4nZA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6H-Qwf4nZA "2 Factor Auth and Single Sign on with Authelia?")

Authelia is an open source Single Sign On and 2FA companion for reverse proxies.  It helps you secure your endpoints with single factor and 2 factor auth.  It works with Nginx, Traefik, and HA proxy.  Today, we'll configure Authelia with Portainer and Traefik and have 2 Factor up and running with brute force protection!

Don't forget to check out the [ðŸš€Launchpad repo](https://l.technotim.live/quick-start) with all of the quick start source files.

## Traefik

Authelia will work with other reverse proxies but I used Traefik.  If you want to configure Traefik as your reverse proxy see this [guide](https://docs.technotim.live/posts/traefik-portainer-ssl/).

## Docker Setup

See [this post](https://docs.technotim.live/posts/docker-compose-install/) on how to install `docker` and `docker-compose`

## Authelia

`configuration.yml`,  `users_database.yml`, and `docker-compose.yml` can be found [here](https://github.com/techno-tim/launchpad/tree/master/docker/authelia)

Example `heimdall` can be found here [here](https://github.com/techno-tim/techno-tim.github.io/tree/master/reference_files/authelia-traefik/heimdall)
