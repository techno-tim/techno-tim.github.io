[![Virtualize vs. Containerize (Which should I choose?)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/pxwUXJmAER4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxwUXJmAER4 "Virtualize vs. Containerize (Which should I choose?)")

Should I virtualize this?  Should I containerize this?  These are great questions to ask yourself when spinning up self-hosted services in your Homelab environment.  We'll review my previous video (20 Ways to Use a Virtual Machine (and other ideas for your homelab https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxwUXJmAER4) and decide which should run in a Docker container, which should be virtualized with Proxmox, and which should run on hardware as bare metal.
