Hi!  My name is Tim but most people call me "Techno Tim"  I create content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/technotimlive) and [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/technotim).  

Here you will find all the documentation for my YouTube videos on my channel [https://www.youtube.com/technotimlive](https://l.technotim.live/subscribe).  This documentation is meant to compliment my videos and not replace them.

If you see something that needs to be fixed, this documentation is open source!  Feel free to open an issue or PR [here](https://github.com/techno-tim/techno-tim.github.io).

You can support this project by becoming a [sponsor on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/timothystewart6) or a [patron on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/technotim).  Thank you for your consideration and for visiting!
