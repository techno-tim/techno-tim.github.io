Let's build a bot!  Not a bad bot like a view bot, but bot for good.  Let's build a Twitch moderator bot using tmi.js!  The Twitch API is powerful and and already has lots of great bots however no bot has the flexibility of creating your own!  In this video I will show you how to build a Twitch bot using TMI.JS from start to finish.  You'll see how to use the developer portal, set up oauth, set the correct scopes, get an access token, create a bot using JavaScript, NodeJS, and NPM, invite the bot to your Twitch channel, and have it moderate your chat.  Also, We have made this bot open source and will continue to contribute to this bot.
