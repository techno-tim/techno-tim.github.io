[![GoXLR WITH WIRELESS HEADSET - Connect ANY wireless bluetooth headphones](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dTd7f-jK_BE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTd7f-jK_BE "GoXLR WITH WIRELESS HEADSET - Connect ANY wireless bluetooth headphones")

Connect any wireless headset to a GoXLR or GoXLR mini. In this video, I show you how you can connect any pair of wireless bluetooth headphones to a GoXLR or GoXLR mini.  They can be AirPods, Beats, Beats Wireless Pro, Bose, or any other wireless bluetooth headset.  You can use this bluetooth adapter transmitter to stream while using the GoXLR or GoXLR mini.

I bought these products with my own money because I thought they were cool.  Nothing in this video was sponsored.
