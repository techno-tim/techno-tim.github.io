[![Everything you need to know about the NEW Rancher UI](https://img.youtube.com/vi/2KSZlE4JTuM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KSZlE4JTuM" "Everything you need to know about the NEW Rancher UI")

Today we're going to talk about the new Cluster Explorer in Rancher.  The Cluster Explorer is the new fancy user interface that will replace the old Cluster Manager.  The new UI contains lots of new areas to explore, from new dashboards to new workload and deployment views, to service discovery, to storage to RBAC, and more.  If you've been hesitant to use the new UI, no need to worry, we all have.  But hopefully after this you'll switch over like I have done too!
