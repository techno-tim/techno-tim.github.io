[![Linux desktop, inside of a container, inside of a browser???  Yes. A Webtop.?](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Gd9bvdkIXOQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd9bvdkIXOQ "Linux desktop, inside of a container, inside of a browser???  Yes. A Webtop.?")

Have you ever thought about running a Linux desktop inside of a container?  Me neither until I found this awesome project from LinuxServer called Webtops.  A webtop is a technology stack that allows you to run Ubuntu or Alpine Linux within a container that is fully accessible from a browser.  This allows you to use most Linux features with a container with a fraction of the cost of resources.  Join me as we configure one from beginning to end.
