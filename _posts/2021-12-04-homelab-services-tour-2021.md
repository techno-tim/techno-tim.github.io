[![HomeLab Services Tour Late 2021 - What am I Self-Hosting in my HomeLab?](https://img.youtube.com/vi/IE5y2_S8S8U/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE5y2_S8S8U "HomeLab Services Tour Late 2021 - What am I Self-Hosting in my HomeLab?")

After showing off my Home Lab hardware in my late 2021 tour, many of you asked what services are self-hosted in this stack.   This is always a moving target so I decided it was time to share which services I am running here at home.  Today, we walk through everything I am hosting including:  Dashboard, Hypervisor, Virtualization, Containerization, Network Attached Storage (NAS), DNS, Network Management, Home Security, Kubernetes, Kubernetes Storage, Docker, Reverse Proxy, Certificates, Monitoring, Logging, Syncing Data, File Sharing, Self-Promotion (Contact Page), Link Shortening, Home Entertainment, Home Automation, Battery / UPS Monitoring, CMS, Static Site Generators, Dynamic DNS, CI/CD, and many, many others.  Enjoy the virtual tour!

Worth mentioning, I [have videos on almost every service mentioned in this video](https://l.technotim.live/subscribe)!
