Let's compare Touch Portal to Stream Deck.  We'll walk through some of the similarities and differences between the free software Touch Portal and the Stream Deck hardware/software combination.  We'll see if we can set up, configure in a step by step guide, and clone our Stream Deck interface for OBS using Touch Portal and a mobile device, we'll review features and experiences, then we'll choose a winner in the Touch Portal vs. Stream Deck face off!
