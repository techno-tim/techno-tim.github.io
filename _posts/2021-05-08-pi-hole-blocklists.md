[![Is adding 3 MILLION domains to your Pi-Hole Block List a good thing?](https://img.youtube.com/vi/0wpn3rXTe0g/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wpn3rXTe0g "Is adding 3 MILLION domains to your Pi-Hole Block List a good thing?")

In some of my previous Pi-Hole videos many of you spotted my blocklist with over a millions sites added and you wondered how you can do the same.  Well, today I show you how to block more ads, block more tracking, block more malware, and block more telemetry with these community lists.  Bonus (and spoiler alert) I show you how to add 3.5 million!

Thanks to Firebog for the great lists [firebog.net](https://firebog.net/)
