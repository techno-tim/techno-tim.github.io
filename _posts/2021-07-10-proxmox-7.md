[![Before you upgrade to Proxmox 7, please consider this...](https://img.youtube.com/vi/RCSp6gT7LWs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCSp6gT7LWs "Before you upgrade to Proxmox 7, please consider this...")

As you may know, proxmox is my current choice for a hypervisor. Proxmox 7 is here and comes with a host of new features!  In this video we're cover all of the new features in Proxmox 7 as well as how to upgrade your Proxmox server safely. We'll also cover all of the "scary" prompts you get while upgrading as well as some of the ways to make sure your upgrade is successful. So, if you're thinking about upgrading your HomeLab to Proxmox 7, be sure to check this video out first.

## Commands

Check your upgrade status

```bash
pve6to7 --full
```

First, make sure we have the latest packages

```bash
apt update
apt dist-upgrade
```

Update all Debian repositories to Bullseye

```bash
sed -i 's/buster\/updates/bullseye-security/g;s/buster/bullseye/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Weâ€™ll also need to make sure we comment out any Proxmox ve 6.0 repositories.

```bash
nano /etc/apt/sources.list
nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list
```

Add Proxmox VE & package Repo

```bash
echo "deb https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/pve bullseye pve-enterprise" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list
```

If youâ€™re using the non-subscription repository (like me) also run

```bash
sed -i -e 's/buster/bullseye/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-install-repo.list 
```

If youâ€™re running Ceph, youâ€™ll need to run

```bash
echo "deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/ceph-octopus bullseye main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
```

Do the upgrade

```bash
apt update
apt dist-upgrade
```

## network changes

If you're running LACP / LAGG I found that you need to make some additional changes to your network config.  See the comments in the config

`/etc/network/interfaces`

```conf
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

#auto eno1 <---  I had to comment this out
iface eno1 inet manual

#auto eno2 <---  I had to comment this out
iface eno2 inet manual

auto bond0
iface bond0 inet manual
        bond-slaves eno1 eno2
        bond-miimon 100
        bond-mode 802.3ad
        bond-xmit-hash-policy layer2+3

auto vmbr0
iface vmbr0 inet static
        address 192.168.0.11/24
        gateway 192.168.0.1
        bridge-ports bond0
        bridge-stp off
        bridge-fd 0
        bridge-vlan-aware yes
        bridge-vids 2-4094
```
