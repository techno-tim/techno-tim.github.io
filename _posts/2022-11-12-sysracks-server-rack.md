I've been on a quest looking for a new server rack for my HomeLab in my home.  I've outgrown my current 18u open frame rack and decided to give a 32u Sysracks Enclosed Rack a try!  Join me as we put together this server rack, test out all of the features, and I'll let you know my thoughts about this brand new server rack!
