It should be something like this:

```bash

```


## nvm

Be sure `zshell` and `oh-my-zsh` are working before continuing

Check this site for the command https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

It should be something like this, but be sure to use the version from the link above

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
```

If `nvm` doesn't work, check this https://youtu.be/kL8iGErULiw?t=507

Close all terminals and all VS Code instances after doing this step

## Install Node

```bash
nvm install 12.16.1
```

## Install yarn

Be sure `nvm` and `node` are working before continuing

Check this site for the latest command https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#alternatives-stable

It should be something like this, but be sure to use the version from the link above

```bash
curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```

You'll want to follow this guide for configuring git.  Be sure to follow the `LINUX` version

https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/getting-started-with-git-and-github
