Do you want the best settings for OBS in 2020? This is the ultimate OBS settings guide with the BEST OBS settings for streaming Fortnite, Just Chatting APEX Legends, PUBG, or really ANY game.  This video includes the best settings for quality, frame rate, bit rate, and audio for streaming at 60 frames per second (FPS) at 1080p (max settings for streamers).  This guide works with OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS (SLOBS), and OBS.LIVE (from StreamElements).  I also include various Windows settings and tweaks to give you the best performance while streaming.  I even cover the new NVENC settings (NVIDIA NVENC H.264 (new) ) for NVidia graphics cards with Turing Architecture. This is a great guide for anyone who wants to tweak their existing settings or have just installed it for the first time with the default settings.
