[![Meet the Turing Pi 2 - Mix Pis and NVidia Jetsons on a  Mini ITX Board!](https://img.youtube.com/vi/PX5UAtPeyd8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX5UAtPeyd8 "Meet the Turing Pi 2 - Mix Pis and NVidia Jetsons on a  Mini ITX Board!")

The Turing Pi 2 is a compact ARM cluster that provides a scalable computing on the edge.  The Turning Pi 2 comes with many improvements over the Turning Pi 1.  This model ships with 32GB of RAM, SATA III interface, Raspberry Pi Compute module 4 support, and support for NVIDIA Jetson boards.  This means that you can mix and match both raspberry Pis along with Nvidia Jetson boards. This gives us a ton of flexibility to be able to run Pis for general compute workloads, and then Nvidia Jetsons for AI or ML workloads.  Join me as we explore the Turing Pi 2 and prepare its home inside of my HomeLab server rack.
