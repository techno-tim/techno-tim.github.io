I am betting you have at least 3 infrared remote controls in your house.  I am also willing to be you would love to automate some of these from time to time.  Well don't worry I have the solution for you!   In this video we walk through setting up a self-hosted /local only Broadlink Wifi Smart Home Hub that you can use within your own home without connecting to the cloud.  Added bonus, I built a Docker container you can pull down and add to your Rancher, Portainer, Synology, QNAP, or any server running Docker or Kubernetes.  This includes a python backend and API as well as a ReactJS frontend so that you can discover, learn, and send commands from the web UI or even from the web API.  I hope you enjoy it!
