There are so many upgrades out there for streaming, what do I start with? Video card? Microphone? Audio? CPU? RAM? Lights?  I started with one that is overlooked by many streamers, and it's the room I stream in.  So come along with me as give a tour of my stream room makeover!  Hopefully this video gives you some stream background ideas for sofas, lights, smart LED lights, accent lighting, coffee tables, plants, rugs, bookshelves, and even Hyrule Historia as I walk through my stream studio setup!
