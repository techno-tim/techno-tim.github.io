Do you have some places where you can't run ethernet?  Do want to extend your ethernet without pulling more cable?  Well this is the guide for you.  In this step-by-step tutorial we'll use a Ubiquiti UniFi AP AC PRO and connect a second as a guest, giving use remote ethernet to a remote site!  This is the pro tip guide to setting up a wireless bridge!  Bonus, we'll even do a live throughput test to see how much bandwidth we get running in bridge mode with 2 AC Pros!
