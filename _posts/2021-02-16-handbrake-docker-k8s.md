Handbrake is a fantastic open source transcoder.  It allows you to transcode, or convert, your video files into different formats. It has a nice UI that's easy to use and helps you transcode videos very easily. It supports profiles that are optimized for your target devices. And because this is open source and cross compiled, you can run this on Windows, macOS, or Linux...  but did you also know you can self host a containerized version of this with Docker and Kubernetes?
