Dear Pi-Hole,
We love your product.  It keeps our network safe from malware and other unwanted domains. While we love what is there so far,  please add a feature to your core product to keep multiple servers in sync and provide high availability DNS to our whole entire network.  Then, we won't have people asking us "Is the internet down?" every time we reboot our Pi-Hole server.  

Until then, we will use Gravity Sync.

Sincerely,

Techno Tim (and probably thousands of other lovers of Pi-Hole).

P.S.  Keep up the good work!

Thank you Gravity Sync! 

(don't forget to star the repo!)
